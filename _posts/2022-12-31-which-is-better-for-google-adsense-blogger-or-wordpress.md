Both [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) are popular platforms that can be used for creating a blog and monetizing it with Google AdSense. Both platforms have their own pros and cons, and which one is better for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences.

**Some of the advantages of using Blogger for Google AdSense are:**

1. **It is owned by Google**: Since Blogger is owned by Google, it is easy to integrate Google AdSense and other Google products into your blog.
2. **It is easy to use**: Blogger has a simple, user-friendly interface that is easy for beginners to use.
3. **It is free**: Blogger is a free platform, which means you can create and publish your blog without having to pay any fees.

**However, there are also some limitations to using Blogger for Google AdSense:**

1. Limited customization options: Blogger has limited customization options compared to WordPress, which means you may not be able to fully customize the look and feel of your blog.
2. Limited SEO options: Blogger has limited SEO options, which means it may be harder to optimize your blog for search engines.

**Some of the advantages of using WordPress for Google AdSense are:**

1. Extensive customization options: WordPress has a wide range of themes and plugins that allow you to fully customize the look and feel of your blog.
2. Strong SEO options: WordPress has a range of SEO-friendly features and plugins that can help you optimize your blog for search engines.
3. Large community: WordPress has a large community of users and developers, which means you can find a lot of resources and support if you have any questions or issues.

However, there are also some limitations to using WordPress for Google AdSense:

1. **It is not free**: While there is a free version of WordPress available (WordPress.org), you will need to pay for hosting and a domain name if you want to use it to monetize your blog with Google AdSense.
2. **It can be more complex**: While WordPress is a powerful platform, it can be more complex than Blogger, which may make it more difficult for beginners to use.

In conclusion, both Blogger and WordPress are good options for creating a blog and monetizing it with Google AdSense. Which one is better for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you are just starting out and want a simple, free platform, Blogger may be the better option. If you want more customization and SEO options, WordPress may be a better choice.
