Why your friends may or may not talk about the Tamil language. There could be many reasons why a person might not discuss a particular language or topic with their friends, and it's important to respect people's choices and interests.

That being said, here are a few possible reasons that your friends may not talk about the Tamil language:

1. They may not be familiar with Tamil or have any personal connection to the language.
2. They may not be interested in Tamil or in learning about languages in general.
3. They may not have had the opportunity to learn about Tamil or may not have had much exposure to it.
4. They may not feel comfortable discussing topics that they are not knowledgeable about or that they do not understand.
5. They may have other interests or priorities that take up their time and attention.

It's important to remember that everyone has different interests and backgrounds, and it's okay to have different experiences and perspectives. If you are interested in Tamil or have a personal connection to the language, it's okay to share your interests and experiences with your friends. However, it's also important to be respectful of their choices and to not try to force them to engage with a topic that they are not interested in.
