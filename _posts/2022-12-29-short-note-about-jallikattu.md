title: Short Note About Jallikattu
---
Jallikattu is a traditional sport that is practiced in Tamil Nadu, India. It involves releasing a bull into a large arena, and participants attempt to grab and hold onto the bull's hump for a certain distance or duration. The sport is considered a part of Tamil culture and has a long history dating back to ancient times.

However, jallikattu has faced controversy and criticism in recent years due to concerns about animal cruelty and safety risks for both the bulls and the participants. In 2014, the Supreme Court of India banned jallikattu, citing animal welfare concerns. The ban was later lifted in 2017, but there are still debates and protests surrounding the sport.

Some proponents of jallikattu argue that it is a cultural tradition that should be preserved, while others believe that the sport should be banned permanently due to the potential harm to both humans and animals. The debate over jallikattu is ongoing and complex, and it highlights the challenges of balancing cultural traditions with modern animal welfare standards.
