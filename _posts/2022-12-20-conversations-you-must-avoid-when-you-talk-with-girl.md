title: Conversations You Must Avoid When You Talk with Girl

---
There are certain types of conversations that may be inappropriate or disrespectful to have with women (or anyone else, for that matter). Here are a few examples:

1. Making inappropriate or sexual comments or jokes.
2. Asking personal questions that are none of your business, such as about their body or relationships.
3. Talking about subjects that may be triggering or sensitive for the other person without their consent.
4. Using derogatory language or making derogatory comments about the other person or their group.
5. Dominating the conversation or making it all about you.

It's important to remember to be respectful and considerate of the other person's feelings and boundaries in any conversation. If you're not sure if a certain topic or comment is appropriate, it's always a good idea to ask the other person before proceeding.
